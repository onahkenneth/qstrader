# QSTrader 

QSTrader is an open-source event-driven backtesting, simulation and live trading platform.

It is currently being rewritten to ensure:

* It is more akin to a portfolio/order management system (OMS)
* It is significantly more optimised for intraday trading (minutely frequency)
* It makes use of up to date versions of Python (3.5-3.6) and libraries
* Simulation accuracy is significantly more realistic with regards transaction costs, restrictions and regulatory constraints

# Development

QSTrader will now make use of the [Gitflow Workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows#gitflow-workflow) approach to version control and deployment.

The most important point of this is that any new feature branches must be branched from the *deployment* branch such that all Pull Requests compare against *develop* rather than *master*. Only *release* branches will be merged into master for deployment.

If you have not utilised a Gitflow workflow before please read the above link to familiarise yourself.

# Trading Disclaimer

Trading equities on margin carries a high level of risk, and may not be suitable for all investors. Past performance is not indicative of future results. The high degree of leverage can work against you as well as for you. Before deciding to invest in equities you should carefully consider your investment objectives, level of experience, and risk appetite. The possibility exists that you could sustain a loss of some or all of your initial investment and therefore you should not invest money that you cannot afford to lose. You should be aware of all the risks associated with equities trading, and seek advice from an independent financial advisor if you have any doubts.
