    """Handles the specific commission model provided
    by the TD Direct UK brokerage firm for UK equities.

    This was written as of 2017/10/02. It assumes these
    charges are active for the life-time of the backtest.
    That is, it does not take into account historic
    commission changes.

    The details can be found here:
    https://www.tddirectinvesting.co.uk/rates-and-charges

    If the trade value is below £100,000 then for the first
    three months there is an introductory rate. After three
    months, for £100,000 there are four separate rates:
    Active, Frequent, Standard and Regular Investment.

    Introductory: £3.95
    Active: Avg 20 or more eligible trades across last 3
        consecutive months: £5.95
    Frequent: Avg 10 or more eligible trades across last 3
        consecutive months: £8.95
    Standard: Avg of less than 10 trades per month across
        last 3 consecutive months: £12.50
    Regular Investment: To buy FTSE350 shares or ETFs by
        monthly Regular Investing facility.

    For transactions £100,000 to £500,000:
    Active, Frequent or Standard rate + £30.00

    For transactions >£500,000:
    Active, Frequent or Standard rate + £60.00

    Stamp Duty is 0.5% per trade of the consideration size, except
    for certain exempt shares.
