class EqualWeightPCM(PortfolioConstructionModel):
    """
    A derived PortfolioConstructionModel class that produces equal
    'dollar' weighting for all Asset entities provided in the list
    of Forecasts.

    It achieves this through the following procedure:
    * Query the Broker entity for the current total market value
        of the Portfolio
    * Estimate the dollar weight of each asset on a 1/N basis
        for all N assets
    * Estimate the likely transaction costs and subtract to leave
        consideration cash available per Asset
    * Divide the consideration by the current market price of the
        Asset and create a desired portfolio with the appropriate
        (conservative) number of shares.

    Parameters
    ----------
    start_dt : pd.Timestamp
        The starting date of the PortfolioConstructionModel
    broker : Broker
        A handle to the live or simulated Broker entity
    broker_portfolio_id : int
        The ID of the portfolio as stored by the Broker entity
    risk_model : RiskModel, optional
        A handle to the RiskModel that governs overall portfolio
        risk behaviour
    transaction_cost_model : TransactionCostModel, optional
        A handle to the TransactionCostModel which governs estimates
        of transaction costs for purposes of estimating trade profits
