class PortfolioConstructionModelException(Exception):

class PortfolioConstructionModel(object):
    """This base class is responsible for converting AlphaModel
    forecasts into explicit Order entities that are sent to
    the brokerage.

    It achieves this by having (optional) references to the
    following entities:

    * Broker - Provides updates on the current live/simulated
        portfolio as well as cash balances. [NON-OPTIONAL]
    * RiskModel - Provides veto power over the construction
        methodology based on various risk factors, such as market
        risk, sector risk, leverage, volatility etc. [OPTIONAL]
    * TransactionCostModel - A model that estimates the transaction
        costs of carrying out any Orders and cancels them using logic
        similar to the following: If the expected profit on the trade
        is less than the expected transaction cost. [OPTIONAL]

    On each 'hearbeat' or 'update' the PCM accepts a new list of Asset
    Forecast entities, which are used as guidance for constructing the
    initial desired portfolio. This is then passed through the
    RiskModel checks and any orders are modified. Finally it is passed
    through the TransactionCostModel checks, which may modify or cancel
    orders further.

    At this stage a 'diff' between the current live/simulated Portfolio
    (as far as the Broker understands it) and the desired portfolio is
    created, which then leads to a set of Order objects.

    Example portfolio construction methodologies (that would be
    implemented by inheriting this PortfolioConstructionModel) could include:

    * Equal weighting of assets by position 'dollar' value
    * Inverse volatility weighting (aka 'Risk Parity') using some form
    of historical, or future-looking, measure/estimate of volatility
    (e.g. trailing annual standard deviation of returns).
    * Modern Portfolio Theory/Mean-Variance Optimisation
    * Hierarchical Risk Parity - Marcos Lopez de Prado's HRP algorithm
