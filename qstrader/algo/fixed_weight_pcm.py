class FixedWeightPCM(PortfolioConstructionModel):
    """
    A derived PortfolioConstructionModel class that produces fixed
    proportion (but potentially unequal) 'dollar' weighting for all
    Asset entities provided in the list of Forecasts, using the
    Forecast 'value' as the weight proportion.

    This value -should- add to one, but if it does not it will be
    rescaled such that the new proportion per asset will be
    fractionally reduced.

    All forecast values must be positive or an exception is raised.

    Example:
    [Forecast(AAPL, 0.4), Forecast(GOOG, 0.3), Forecast(AMZN, 0.5)]
    -> Total value of forecast does not sum to 1.0, instead it is: 1.2
    -> Therefore:
        AAPL becomes 0.4/1.2, GOOG becomes 0.3/1.2, AMZN becomes 0.5/1.2

    It achieves this through the following procedure:
    * Query the Broker entity for the current total market value
        of the Portfolio
    * Estimate the dollar weight of each asset
    * Estimate the likely transaction costs and subtract to leave
        consideration cash available per Asset
    * Divide the consideration by the current market price of the
        Asset and create a desired portfolio with the appropriate
        (conservative) number of shares.

    Parameters
    ----------
    start_dt : pd.Timestamp
        The starting date of the PortfolioConstructionModel
    broker : Broker
        A handle to the live or simulated Broker entity
    broker_portfolio_id : int
        The ID of the portfolio as stored by the Broker entity
    risk_model : RiskModel, optional
        A handle to the RiskModel that governs overall portfolio
        risk behaviour
    transaction_cost_model : TransactionCostModel, optional
        A handle to the TransactionCostModel which governs estimates
        of transaction costs for purposes of estimating trade profits
    reblance_times : TODO: Add class description in!
    adjustment_factor : float, optional
        The total percentage (between 0.0 and 1.0) of the portfolio to
        allocate away from cash. That is, if adjustment_factor=0.99,
        1% of the portfolio remains in cash.
